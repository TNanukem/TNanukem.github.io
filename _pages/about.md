Welcome to my page. My name is Tiago Toledo Junior, I'm currently living in SÃ£o Carlos, Brazil were I'm finish the last semester of my Computer Engineering course. I'm also an Data Scientist Intern at Big Data.

There are three things that make me get out of bed in the morning: entrepreneurship, personal development and technology.

The entrepreneurship because it allows me to change the world and not simply wait for it to change. The personal development because it allows the continuous improvement in everything that I do and finally, the technology because it has the tools that I can use to transform the world and myself.

Because of that, I'm in love with the most diverse areas e I am always looking forward to get a deeper knowledge in each of them: leadership and management, coaching, low-level programming, data science and machine learning, parallel computing and cloud computing, market research, strategic planning.

All of that aligns with my mission: change the world where I live using these three elements.
