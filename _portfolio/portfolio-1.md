EPCSAC is an online platform that allows researchers to upload cloud scheduling algorithms, configure experiments and compare their performance with others algorithms that are published. This way, the platform hopes to solve the overhead related to simulation enviroment configuration and improve reproducibility of the results obtained and pubslihed by the researchers.

See more about it on [Github](https://github.com/TNanukem/EPCSAC).
